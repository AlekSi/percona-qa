# ------ Common Issues ------
# Ever seen "-bash: !": event not found" when you were trying to use '!' in for example a sed command? Try for examle: echo "!" | sed 's|!|found|' - the fix;
  histchars=  # in ./bash_profile (or at the command line) will fix it. Reason; https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/History-Interaction.html
# Unlike echo -n, sed cannot parse a live input stream and print the result on a single line step-by-step as the input comes in. Proof;
  for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo $i; sleep 1; done | sed -n "H;/[369]/{x;s/\n/ /g;p}"  # Ref https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html#fn-3
# While the above cannot be done with sed, it can be done quite easily with awk. Semi-similar example, showing output, progressively, on one line;
  for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo $i; sleep 0.3; done | awk '/[369]/{printf "%s",$0}'  # To make example above 100% similar, use: sed -n "/[369]/{s/\n/ /g;p}"
# When calling a function in the background (like the example on the next line) in a script, remember that such a function runs in a subshell
  function &  # By calling a function this way, all variables used within it will be fresh/new and any variables updated will not reflect back in the parent
# When checking for the existence of a directory, do not just use:  if [ -d ${SOME_VAR} ]; then echo "yes"; fi  The reason is that if ${SOME_VAR} is empty,
  the check will still work. Confirm the gotcha by executing:  if [ -d ]; then echo "yes"; fi  Instead, use:  if [ "${SOME_VAR}" != "" -a -d ${SOME_VAR} ];
# Along the same lines of the last issue, it is an easy mistake to make not to include double quotes around variables when checking for (in)equality. Use;
  if [ "${SOME_VAR}" == "Some Text" ]; then ...; fi  instead of not using double quotes (which fails when the variable is empty).
# If you see an error like '/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsnappy' when compiling, then it means that the snappy (for example) library cannot be found.
  To discover the real source, run  ld -lsnappy --verbose  and look near the end for the locations is scans for 'attempt to open ...' 
  If you have the library in a specific location, you can use;  sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libsnappy.so.1 /usr/lib64/libsnappy.so  or use -L option to your compiler!
